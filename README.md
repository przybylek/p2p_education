### Key Questions for Learners (Tutees):

1. How is the peer-to-peer education model different from traditional teaching methods in your experience? In which areas do you find it more effective?
2. What are the biggest challenges you have faced while receiving peer support through a digital platform? (e.g., communication barriers, lack of motivation, technical issues, etc.)
3. How would you prefer to interact with your tutors? (e.g., in a more formal, guidance-focused, or friendly way?)
4. What features should a dedicated P2P learning platform have to be most effective?
5. How would you like your progress to be tracked on such a platform?
6. How has the digital P2P education affected your learning speed, quality, and self-confidence?
7. What do you think are the biggest advantages and disadvantages of this P2P system?

## Declaration on the Use of Large Language Models

For transparency, we note that LLMs were used in a supplementary role during thematic analysis. After manually developing initial codes and identifying themes, we prompted LLMs to suggest improved names and help draft concise descriptions for these concepts. All final code names and descriptions were refined and approved by the research team.

Additionally, we utilized LLMs to improve the language and readability of the paper. The authors subsequently reviewed and edited all AI-generated suggestions and take full responsibility for the final content of the published paper.
